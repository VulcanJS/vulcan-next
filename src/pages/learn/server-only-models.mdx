# Step 4: Server-side models

## Why you need server-only code

Vulcan models are an **isomorphic** feature.
It means that models work both client-side, for the front-end user interface,
and server-side, for the backend business logic.

That makes sense, because models represent real-life objects.
Whether you are creating a form or an API endpoint,
a blog Author is still an Author,
so it's a good practice to share as much code as possible.

However, some code should stay private.
For example, the code that process user password belongs to the server.
It should not be included in the client bundle and shared to users.

## Discover the User model server code

The User model is a good example of server-only features.

Open `src/models/user.server.ts`.

You'll see:

- **Model specific logic**: a bunch of functions related to users
- **Server-only fields**: fields you **don't** want to see in the user interface
- **Server callbacks**: functions that are called on certain events (creation, update, deletion...),
  like sending an email on success, modifying data before storing them etc.
- **Custom field-resolvers**: some data might **not** be stored outside of your database.
  For instance, you might want to get information about the user from the Twitter API.
  To do so, you can use a custom field resolver, with the `resolveAs` property.

It is a very advanced model: it handles user signup and authentication.
Since those features are related to security, you want them to
happen server-side.

Hopefully, your models will be simpler than that most of the time!

## Exporting server models

**Always remember to export your model in `src/models/index.server` to activate this automated generation.**

Those models will be automatically added to your GraphQL API
and Mongo database. Awesome!

Notice the `.server`. In Vulcan, whenever you see a folder named `server`, or
a file named `*.server.ts`, it means that it contains server-only code.

## Go to step 5

First, please answer this question:

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What does the User model do when creating a new user?"
  answers={[
    "It hashes the provided password before storing it, using the 'create' callback.",
    "It sends an email to the moderators.",

  ifOk={
    <NextMuiButton variant="contained" href="/learn/graphql-server">
      Click to go to next step
    </NextMuiButton>
  }
/>

export default function ServerOnlyModels(props) {
  return <LearnLayout {...props} />;
}
